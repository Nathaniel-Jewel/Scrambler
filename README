Project: scramble.js

Description:

	Scores the difficulty of any particular scrambling of a word. The scores can be not,
	poor, fair or hard, depending on whether or not the scramble is not scrambled, easy to solve, a reasonable difficulty to solve or hard to solve, respectively.

Requirements:

	You will need Node.js and npm installed.

Running the Project:

	Example:

	node scramble.js '["MAPS SPAM", "RIONY IRONY", "ONYRI IRONY", "IRONY IRONY", "INOYR IRONY", "IOYRN IRONY"]'

	or 

	node scramble.js -file test.txt

	where text.txt contains a comma seperated list with only a single space between the scramble and word.
	However having any number of spaces or newline breaks before/after each element is fine.

		Example of test.txt:

		MAPS SPAM, RIONY IRONY, ONYRI IRONY, IRONY IRONY, INOYR IRONY, IOYRN IRONY

		is handled the same as:

		  MAPS  SPAM,
		RIONY IRONY, 
		ONYRI IRONY, 
		IRONY IRONY, INOYR IRONY, IOYRN IRONY, 
		CHAI ACIH


Additonal Commenents:

	Normally if i was writitng a node.js project that needed command line arguements i would install a package like minimist or yargs. However packages seemed unessesary for this project so i avoided them.

	If the scramble or the word are not A-Z letters i print an input error message to console for that element and try to process the other elemenents. 

	If the scramble and the word are A-Z letters, but are different words then the element gets assigned a 'Not' difficulty.

	In the PDF, SWR was giving as being invalid, because combinations can't overlap. I also interperated SWCH as invalid even though SW is valid and CH is valid, because WC is breaking the alternating rule.
